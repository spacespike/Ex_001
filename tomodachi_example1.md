# Welcoming message


Hello my friends! 

Let's test what you've learned.

## To-do

* First, **fork** this repo.

* Then, clone it to your local workstation.

* Then create and switch to a new branch.

* Then make some notes. For example I've created some titles and you can add a descriptions and some labels that used with the commands, for example "git commit -m".

Feel free to play around with markdown too, try to add pictures or gifs to make this doc as userfull as we can.

good luck and enjoy! :)
